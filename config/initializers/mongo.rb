# The following indexes were created manually (in the background)
# ** We are not running these programatically as they can be VERY slow! **
# ** Do not use :index => true in your models **
#
# EXAMPLE  Used by index to get broadcasts for users channel, this needs to be very efficient as it affects loading of the app
# EXAMPLE Broadcast.ensure_index([[:channel_id, 1], [:created_at, -1], [:video_player, 1]], :background => true)
